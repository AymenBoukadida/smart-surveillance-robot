# ü§ñ Smart Surveillance Robot

### üß† Project Overview
The **Smart Surveillance Robot** is an AI-powered security system that integrates **computer vision**, **speech recognition**, and **automation** to enhance real-time surveillance.  
It detects and recognizes individuals, identifies suspicious activity, and automatically triggers alerts through **audio, email, and SMS notifications**.

## üß© System Architecture

### üé• 1. Camera Input
- The system uses the **Raspberry Pi Camera (Picamera2)** or a standard webcam.
- Captures live video frames continuously for analysis.

### üß† 2. Face Recognition Module
- Uses the **face_recognition** library to:
  - Encode known faces from an `images/` directory.
  - Compare real-time faces with known encodings.
- If the face is recognized:
  - The person‚Äôs name is displayed.
  - Their attendance is logged with a timestamp.
  - A welcome message is spoken.
- If the face is **unknown**:
  - An image of the intruder is saved.
  - SMS and email alerts are triggered.

### üßæ 3. Object Detection Module
- Powered by **TensorFlow Lite** for efficient on-device inference.
- Loads a pre-trained `detect.tflite` model and `labelmap.txt` labels.
- Detects specific objects (e.g., ‚Äúvol‚Äù or suspicious items).
- When detected, an alarm sound is played and an alert is sent.

### üîä 4. Audio and Voice System
- **pyttsx3** handles text-to-speech for spoken messages.
- **SpeechRecognition** is used for voice-based password verification.
- A voice challenge is presented to verify access if needed.

### üì° 5. Alerting Mechanisms
- **Email Alerts:**  
  Sends a message with an attached image and audio file to a predefined address when an unknown person is detected.
- **SMS Alerts:**  
  Uses the **Vonage API** to instantly notify the owner via text message.
- **Alarm Sound:**  
  Plays an audio warning or alarm tone locally when triggered.

### üßæ 6. Attendance Logging
- Each recognized individual is automatically recorded in an `attendance.csv` file with their name and time of detection.

### üßµ 7. Multithreading
- Threads are used for handling simultaneous tasks:
  - Face recognition
  - Voice verification
  - Directory monitoring
  - Email/SMS alerts
- This ensures smooth real-time operation without lag.
