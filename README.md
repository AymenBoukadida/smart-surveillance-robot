#smart surveillance robot:

DESCRIPTION:
The robot would consist of a Raspberry Pi 4 computer connected to a camera module for image and video capture, a microphone for audio input, a speaker for audio output, and sensors for detecting objects. The robot could be mounted on a wheeled or stationary base, depending on the desired mobility.

The software running on the Raspberry Pi 4 would use OpenCV for image processing and object detection. It would also use a pre-trained machine learning model for facial recognition and speech recognition. When an unknown face is detected, the robot would take a photo and send an email alarm to the user to notify them of the event. When a "vol"  object is detected, the robot would sound an audio alarm through its speaker and end a mail along with the picture of the object
